# Company

The company command in the passfinder CLI tool is designed to generate a list of probable passwords based on specific information about a company. By simply providing the company's name, this command can create a variety of potential passwords using different transformation and combination techniques. These techniques include adding the current year, varying the case of letters, including special characters, and more. The primary goal is to provide a list of passwords that are not only robust but also relevant to the company, thereby facilitating security testing and password audits.
